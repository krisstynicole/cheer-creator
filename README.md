In this Repository, you will find some practice problems that I solved. 
I am new to coding and want to try to learn as much as I can and what best way 
to do that by solving some practice problems. 

All problems are found using apps like sololearn or other practice problems via the internet.
The codings are 100% by me. PLEASE NO STEALING OF CODES! I code using C Language. 
Eventually, I will try to come up with my own problems to solve.
