# cheer-creator

Cheer creator is a practice problem I solved. Here is the problem...

You are cheering on your favorite team. After each play, if your team got over 10 yards further down the field, you stand
up and give them a "high five". If they don't move forward by at least a yard you stay quiet and say "shh", and if they move 
forward 10 yards or less, you say "Ra!" for every yard that they moved forward in that play. 

Task: 
Given the number of yards that your team moved forward, output either 'high five' (for over 10), 'shh' (for <1), or a string 
that has a 'Ra!' for every yard they they gained. 

My Pseudocode I came up with to help code this problem..
If input is over 10
then output 'high five'
if input is greater than 1 & less than 10
then output "Ra!'
if input is less than 1
then output 'shh'
